Messie Messenger Roadmap Home (Draft)
=====================================

This folder houses product-planning notes split by domain. Each document follows a light PRD style: current gaps, desired experience, and open questions.

Roadmap sections
----------------

- Matrix module: `docs/roadmap/matrix.md`
- Email module: `docs/roadmap/email.md`
- Todo module: `docs/roadmap/todo.md`
- Shared platform & UX: `docs/roadmap/shared.md`

How to use
----------

- Keep high-level bullets in `docs/architecture.md` aligned with these detailed plans.
- When a section graduates to an ADR or implementation ticket, link it from the relevant roadmap doc.
- Feel free to add more files (e.g., calendar.md) if a domain grows large enough to merit a split.
