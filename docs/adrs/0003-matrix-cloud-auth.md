# ADR 0003: Matrix OpenID â†’ Backend JWT Bridge

Summary
-------

Describe and standardize the flow where the web client exchanges a Matrix OpenID Connect token for a backend-issued JWT so that todos, email helpers, and future services can share a single session model.

Problem
-------

- Users authenticate with Matrix to unlock chat, but the Go backend requires its own JWT for protected endpoints.
- Ad-hoc token exchanges lead to inconsistent storage, unclear failure handling, and no guidance for other clients (desktop, mobile) to adopt the same bridge.
- We need a documented contract that covers discovery, token verification, persistence, and security responsibilities for both client and server.

Goals
-----

1. Define the canonical request/response shape for `/auth/matrix/openid`.
2. Capture how the backend verifies Matrix-issued OpenID tokens and provisions local users.
3. Describe client expectations: storage, expiration handling, and retry guidance.
4. Highlight security considerations (homeserver trust, TLS, token lifetime) and extension points (refresh, logout).

Non-Goals
---------

- Building a Matrix login UI (handled elsewhere).
- Defining OAuth/OpenID flows for non-Matrix identity providers.
- Handling refresh tokens or long-lived backend sessions (future work).

Current State
-------------

- Frontend calls `matrixClient.getOpenIdToken()` and POSTs to `/api/v1/auth/matrix/openid` using the generated OpenAPI client.
- Backend resolves the Matrix homeserver via `.well-known`, calls `/openid/userinfo`, then creates or fetches a local user and issues a 24h JWT.
- Tokens are cached in `localStorage` under `cloud_auth` (JSON) with a legacy fallback key `cloud_jwt`.
- Failure paths and expiry handling are only logged to console; there is no UX messaging or refresh mechanism.

Proposed Flow (v1)
------------------

1. **Client obtains token** using Matrix OpenID API.
2. **Client POSTs** JSON body:

   ```json
   {
     "access_token": "<opaque>",
     "matrix_server_name": "example.com"
   }
   ```

   to `/api/v1/auth/matrix/openid` (same shape as `MatrixOpenIDRequest`).
3. **Server resolves homeserver**:
   - Fetch `https://<server>/.well-known/matrix/server`.
   - Fallback to `https://<server>` when record is absent.
4. **Server verifies token** against `/_matrix/federation/v1/openid/userinfo`.
5. **Server upserts user** by MXID, issuing JWT with 24h expiry, and returns:

   ```json
   {
     "token": "<jwt>",
     "mxid": "@alice:example.com",
     "userId": "<uuid>"
   }
   ```
6. **Client persists response** in `localStorage` and sets `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` for future API calls.
7. **Expiration**: Client should track `exp` claim and re-run the flow on expiry (TODO in backlog).

Security Considerations
-----------------------

- Only accept HTTPS `.well-known` responses; reject HTTP or mismatched MXIDs.
- JWT secret must be configured via `JWT_SECRET` and rotated when compromised.
- Rate-limit authentication attempts to avoid brute force with stolen Matrix tokens.
- Consider caching homeserver discovery to minimize repeated network calls.
- Future enhancement: allow operator-configured allowlist/denylist of homeservers.

Client Responsibilities
-----------------------

- Persist `mxid`, `userId`, and `token` atomically; clear on logout.
- Inspect JWT expiry and re-authenticate proactively (to be implemented).
- Surface clear error messaging when homeserver discovery or verification fails.
- Avoid leaking Matrix OpenID tokens by ensuring HTTPS and short-lived storage.

Server Responsibilities
-----------------------

- Validate the Matrix token with the correct federation base.
- Guarantee idempotent user creation keyed by MXID.
- Return standard error codes: `400` (bad request), `401` (verification failed), `500` (internal).
- Log verification failures with sanitized messages (no raw tokens).

Open Questions
--------------

- Should we persist additional metadata (display name, avatar) alongside MXID during provisioning?
- Do we need to expose logout/revocation endpoints to invalidate JWTs before expiry?
- Should we support longer-lived refresh tokens or rotate JWT secret per user session?
- How will desktop/native clients share the stored credentials securely?

Appendix: Implementation Notes
------------------------------

- Handler lives at `backend/internal/user/handler/auth_handler.go:30`.
- Frontend bridge is `frontend/src/viewmodels/cloud-auth/CloudAuthViewModel.ts`.
- Generated OpenAPI models: `MatrixOpenIDRequest`, `MatrixAuthResponse`.
- Local storage key: `cloud_auth` (stringified response).
