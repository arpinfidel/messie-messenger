Messenger App Plan
Overall Goal
The primary objective is to develop a comprehensive messenger application, similar to Lark, that seamlessly integrates various communication and productivity tools such as chat, email, and calendar within a unified interface.

Future Integrations
Matrix Integration
### Implementation Approach
* **Architecture Pattern:** MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
* **SDK:** `matrix-js-sdk`
* **Core Component:** `MatrixViewModel` to manage:
  * Session storage/restoration
  * User authentication (initial hardcoded credentials with self-verification)
  * End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) management
  * Room management integrated with unified timeline

### Integration Points
* **Unified Timeline:** Rooms represented as MatrixTimelineItem objects
* **Detail Panel:**
  - ChatDetail component integration
  - Message sending/receiving functionality
  - Encryption status display

### Future Authentication Roadmap
1. Implement SAS (Secure Authenticated Session)
2. Develop settings page with:
   - Tabbed interface for multiple modules
   - Consistent configuration layout across services
   - Matrix-specific authentication settings

### Design Principles
* **Generalizable Pattern:** Implement `IModuleViewModel` interface for future module compatibility
* **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Core logic in ViewModel
  - UI-specific methods in dedicated component files
  - Authentication flow decoupled from main business logic

Internal Services
Email, calendar, and todo functionalities will be powered by our own services. These services are envisioned as a collection of microservices, operating behind an API gateway to ensure scalability and maintainability.

User Interface
Unified Sidebar/Timeline
All core modules, including chat, email, and calendar, will be presented within a single, integrated sidebar/timeline. This design aims to provide a cohesive and chronological view of all user activities.

Detail Panel
A dedicated right panel will display the detailed content corresponding to the selected item from the sidebar/timeline. This includes, but is not limited to, chat conversations, full email content, and calendar event details.

Email Grouping Rules for Timeline
Default Grouping
Emails will generally be grouped into a single item on the timeline to maintain a clean and concise view.

Email Threads
Once an email evolves into a thread (i.e., receives replies), it will be displayed as an individual item on the timeline, allowing for easy tracking of ongoing conversations.

Important Emails
Emails marked as important will also be grouped into a separate, distinct item on the timeline for quick identification and access.

Core Principles
Offline-First
The application will be designed with an offline-first approach, ensuring core functionalities remain accessible and responsive even without an active internet connection.

Cached Data Display
The application will always prioritize displaying cached data to the user, providing an immediate and consistent experience.

Offline Updates and Sync
Users will be able to perform updates and actions while offline. These changes will be synchronized with the backend services once an internet connection is re-established.

Technology Stack
Frontend Framework: Svelte
Build Tool: Vite
CSS Framework: Tailwind CSS

## Project Structure
The project will utilize a monorepo structure.

## Frontend Scaffold Requirements (for future implementation)
Sidebar/Timeline Component
A robust sidebar/timeline component needs to be developed.

Multi-Module Item Acceptance
The timeline component must be capable of accepting and displaying items originating from various modules (e.g., chat messages, emails, calendar events).

Module Update Mechanism
Modules will be responsible for sending updates to the timeline, ensuring that the displayed information is always current.

Initial Data Fetch
The timeline will be designed to fetch its initial data upon application load.

Abstracted Module Interaction
Interactions with individual modules should be abstracted. This means avoiding custom interaction logic for each module and instead implementing a generalized mechanism for handling user input and module responses.

Backend Placeholders
All backend functionality will initially be represented by placeholders, allowing for frontend development to proceed independently.
